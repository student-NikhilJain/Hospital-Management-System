# Hospital-Management-System
The Hospital Management System project is built using Tkinter for the GUI and SQL for database connectivity. It manages patient data, prescriptions, and medications. Features include adding, updating, and displaying records. The project enhanced my skills in Python, Tkinter, and SQL database management.
